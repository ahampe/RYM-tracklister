These are the instructions for changing the settings in settings.txt.
Note:  If you're copying from discogs, please Hide Credits (at the top right) for tracks before copying. This makes things much easier.

1. Enter the source of your copied tracklist after "Source:", either by typing the full name or using the listed abbreviations. Note that RYM itself is an acceptable source (copy tracklist from "advanced" section in release correction)
-If you're using an "other" source, you can enter, in each line folllowing "Source:", any exact phrases (from the text you copied) you want removed from the output (case-sensitive). For example, entering "Sample this track " would delete that phrase AND the space after it for each track, if the phrase is found.
--If there are URLs or slightly-varying texts that you want to delete, you can type part of the word, then type a !@ at the beginning and/or end of the word to delete all the non-space text before and/or after the word, respectively. For example, entering "http://!@" would delete any URLs that begin with http:// from each line.
--If you want the entire line to be deleted (not just the word), then use @@ at the beginning or end of the line you're entering. There's no need to enter @@ twice. For example, "Buy this@@" or "@@Buy this" would delete any lines in the input file that contain that phrase.

2. Enter "y" or "n" after "Is_VA:" to indicate whether the release is a various artists release or not. Note that "other" sources do not support this feature. You will have to enter the artist link yourself, if needed.

3. Enter the language of the copied tracklist after "Language:", either by typing the language name or using the listed abbreviations. Enter a 0 if you don't want to change the capitalization at all. 
-If you're entering info for a classical release, and the tempo indications (or anything after roman numerals) are in Italian, you can enter "e i" after "Language:" to use English on the regular titles and Italian capitalization only on movements (this works similarly for other languages; Italian is just very common, e.g., "String Quartet No. 3 in A minor: I. Allegro moderato").

4. For Discogs: Determine whether you want to merge sub-tracks (which are tracks that are further divided into songs or movements). Type "y" after "Merge:" to bring all sub-tracks into one track, or "n" to leave the subtracks as they are. I would recommend merging for classical releases only.

5. If the release is classical, enter classical release info after "Begin_adding_next_line:". The information entered in this section is case-sensitive. There is a lot of info on this part. See the EXAMPLES section if anything is unclear.

There are two scenarios for classical works: "main" works (with child works) and other works:

--------Main works:--------
The main work should not be on a track. The movements of the work, however, should be on tracks (multiple movements can exist on one track).
For each main work, enter in a new line the following information, separated by spaces: The track number of the first movement (optional, see NOTE), the shortcut for the work, and the number of movements.
For multi-disc CDs, type either a period or a hyphen between the disc and track (no spaces).
If you just want to insert a main work without any movements (for whatever reason), enter 0 for number of movements and the work will be inserted in a title immediately ABOVE that track.
Normally, movements are numbered sequentially after the main work (e.g. [Work5] may have movements [Work6], [Work7], etc.)
-If the above is NOT the case, then enter the shortcut for each movement AFTER the number of movements, separated by spaces.
-If the movements were all added at a later time, but are still numbered regularly... (e.g. [Work2] has movements [Work15], [Work16], [Work17], etc.), then you only need to enter the first shortcut, and the rest of the movements will be filled automatically.

NOTE: If you're entering shortcuts in the order they appear in the tracklist, you can omit the disc+track number entirely, and the script will fill the information in sequentially for you. If a disc+track number is entered on the previous line, the script will place the next shortcut in the next available track (and it takes movements into account). It also doesn't matter if the movements span multiple discs.

EXAMPLES for main works:
-"A2 [Work1234] 2" would insert a link to [Work1234] between tracks A1 and A2, a link to [Work1235] on track A1, and a link to [Work1236] on track A2.
-"1.10 [Work999] 0" would insert a link to [Work999] between tracks 1.9 and 1.10
-"3.1 [Work4] 3 [Work100]" would link to [Work4] just before disc 3, link to [Work100] on 3.1, [Work101] on 3.2, and [Work102] on 3.3
-"D6 [Work13] 2 [Work19] [Work25]" would link to [Work13] just between D5 and D6, link [Work19] on D6, and link [Work25] on E1 (assuming here a new disc begins after track D6).
-"[Work65] 2" let's say you entered this line immediately after the last example. The shortcut to [Work65] would then be placed between E1 and E2, and the movements, [Work66] and [Work67], would be placed on E2 and E3, respectively.

--------Other works:--------
If the work is not a main work (i.e., has no movements), simply enter the track where it appears and the shortcut.
If you're entering works that are numbered sequentially (e.g., [Work6] on track 1, [Work7] on track 2), then you can enter the number of works that will be inserted after the first and a "!" after the first work link.
If there are multiple works on one track, separate the shortcuts by a '.' (don't use spaces)
-Note that, if you do specify more than one work on a track, the script may not find the correct place to insert the work shortcuts. If that happens, you will see "EDIT ME" in one of the shortcuts.
--You will then need to cut and paste the info into the correct shortcut.
--Good characters for separating tracks containing multiple works are: semicolon (; ), slash ( / ), ampersand ( & ), plus ( + ), and comma (,). 

NOTE AGAIN: If you're entering shortcuts in the order they appear in the tracklist, you can omit the disc+track number entirely, and the script will fill the information in sequentially for you. If a disc+track number is entered on the previous line, the script will place the next shortcut in the next available track.

EXAMPLES for other works:
-"7 [Work404]" would insert a link to [Work404] directly on track 7
-"5 [Work100] 2!" would insert a link to [Work100] on track 5, [Work101] on track 6, and [Work102] on track 7.
-"B1 [Work10].[Work11]" would insert a link to both [Work10] and [Work11] on track B1.
-"[Work77].[Work88]" Let's say you entered this as the very first line under "Begin_adding..". The link to both [Work77] and [Work88] would be placed on track A1 (if vinyl) or 1 (if CD/digital).
